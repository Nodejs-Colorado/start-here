### Meetups

#### 2/18/2014

- For our first meetup, Michael Herman introduced Node.js, creating an application displaying live tweets. [Blog Post](http://mherman.org/blog/2014/02/19/node-twitter-sentiment/#.UyiDUa1dVSQ).

#### 3/17/2014

- Michael Herman went over the [intro](http://mherman.org/blog/2014/02/19/node-twitter-sentiment/#.UyiDUa1dVSQ) again then built on that same intro with Async and Promises. [Blog Post](http://mherman.org/blog/2014/03/18/node-twitter-sentiment-part-2/#.UyiR861dVSQ) and [Slides](https://github.com/Nodejs-Colorado/node-meetup-03172014)
- Excellent resource [http://frederic.vanderessen.com/better-javascript-promises/](http://frederic.vanderessen.com/better-javascript-promises/)

#### 3/22/2014

- Group member [Manish Vachharajani](https://twitter.com/mvachhar) Manish Vachharajani gave a talk called *Embedding Node.js into a High-performance Network Datapath*, which he originally gave at NodeSummit in December 2013.  The talk covers how he and his team modified Node.js so that they could embed it into their C++ datapath in order to handle over 200,000 TCP session per second on a single 2 socket server.


### Future Meeting Ideas

1. Tools: task runner, deployments, builds
2. Boilerplates
3. Basic Intro
4. Testing

Issue a PULL to add your own or add them right to the Meetup page. Cheers!
